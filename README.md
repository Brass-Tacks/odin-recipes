# odin-recipes
An HTML webpage created during the Odin Project.

This is my first project done alone and committed to Github. This is a project
I created through following the Odin Project, an online opensource program,
to teach coding basics and fullstack dev.


---------------------------Expectations and thoughts:---------------------------

I've browsed some of the other projects created for this program and they
seem basic, there's not too much pressure. But I think I'm going to try my
best to see what interesting things I can create for this first project.
Maybe some sort of cool graphic? We'll see.

...Also if Nina is reading this. Hi Nina! :)
