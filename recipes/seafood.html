<h2 class="subs">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Mince 2 of the garlic cloves. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion, fennel, celery, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the minced garlic and red-pepper flakes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add squid. Cook, stirring occasionally, until squid is opaque and tender and the released juices reduce, 15 to 20 minutes. Add tomato paste and oregano and cook, stirring, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add wine, raise heat to medium-high, and cook until cooking liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juice, bay leaves, clam juice, and stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, 30 minutes. Stir in ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the butter, 1 tablespoon parsley, lemon zest, and ¼ teaspoon salt together. Cut remaining garlic clove in half and rub the cut sides on the toasts. Spread the flavored butter on the toasts.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, heat the pot to medium and add clams, cover, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and mussels. Arrange the fish on top of the stew, cover, and simmer until shellfish opens and fish and shrimp are firm and opaque, about 5 minutes more. Discard bay leaves and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve cioppino immediately in large soup bowls with gremolata toasts alongside.</li>
