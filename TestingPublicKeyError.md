Ignore this file, this is an attempt to fix VSCode's error in accepting commits.

I can commit and clone from terminal but when making a commit on VSC, it returns the error "git@github.com permission denied (publickey)"

It's not a terrible issue but I would like to fix it before I focus on other projects.

Fix:

...So apparently I was mashing the enter key instead of putting a password in so now commits work. Please pick from one of the excuses below.

- Didn't have my coffee.
- Had to be up early this morning.
- Was jamming too much to Portugal. The Man to notice. (Feel It Still specifically)

Anyway. If you're reading this, have a good day. I'm just working through learning all this. :)
