Ignore this file, this is an attempt to fix VSCode's error in accepting commits.

I can commit and clone from terminal but when making a commit on VSC, it returns the error "git@github.com permission denied (publickey)"

It's not a terrible issue but I would like to fix it before I focus on other projects.
